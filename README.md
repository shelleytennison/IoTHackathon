Executive Summary

Situation
Our world needs more sustainable energy generation.  Humans move around all day long.  They do some of those motions in a repetitive way like walking, running, cycling.
The motions people do could generate energy.  Kinetic energy harvesting is the generation of “free” energy from common human activities could be a sustainable way to energize the world in a local way.  The energy generated could be stored in a battery or put into the power grid. 
To build kinetic energy generation systems, there is a need to understand how much human motion there is and where the most human most is located.

Problem Statement
Kinetic energy generation has significance costs to develop the optimal locations with the most energy generation for the least cost.  Prioritization of costs and energy generation development time is needed to identify the highest yield of kinetic generating energy location and activities.  
There is a need to have a way to understand the return on investment by testing amount and frequency of kinetic energy spots to identify best places to create kinetic energy generation areas.  There is currently not a way to monitor human (and other) motion to understand where the most motion is occurring.

Solution
fluxTrac – a hand-held measurement instrument that can capture motion activity
Product Description
•	Portable unit that captures and monitors kinetic energy generation.  
•	Unit will have a screen that creates indication of threshold of “good” ROI location, “medium” ROI location or “poor” ROI location to provide immediate feedback.
•	Data is sent to cloud database to track results.  

Target Customer
Customer Definition - B2B channel
Potential customers types – 
•	Energy generation solution providers use tool to develop proposals, track installation, monitor performance of kinetic generation energy systems.  
•	Architects who monitor human traffic patterns in buildings they are remodeling

Competitive Environment
Potential energy related alternative product are focused on small devices that convert kinetic energy in to electric energy.  Small devices that harvest energy through kinetic energy.  Energy capture units are embedded into shoes to capture heat that is converted into energy sent to wireless device.  One example is InStep NanoPower.  They have developed an inexpensive simple high-power energy harvester capable of converting mechanical energy into electrical power  http://www.instepnanopower.com/
Other related devices monitor energy for homes or other buildings.  These connect into utility panels to monitor the flow of electricity or other energy sources.  Energy meter/monitoring systems. Energy meters

Future Ideas
Apply motion sensor capabilities for inanimate object motions like cars, trains, planes, elevators, etc
Locations for energy generation can be outside, like roads, trains, public places (airports, etc). Inside locations can be offices, building, gyms.   Fitness gym locations offer concentrated opportunities for generating energy with treadmills, stationary bikes, or other athletic equipment.  
Cars, trains, elevators, and other items that move could also generate energy.

Motions that people do like walking or cycling could generate energy.  
Kinetic energy harvesting is the harvesting of “free” energy from common human activities could be a sustainable way to energize the world in a local way.
Various motions can be harvested to generate kinetic energy to be stored in a battery or put into the power grid.

Building re-design, remodeling is another area that needs to understand the human movement patterns.
